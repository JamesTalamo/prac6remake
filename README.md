# prac6remake
This is the remake of practice 6 i did back then, This time this web app is DYNAMIC means all the content that you see here is all at the back end!

How did i did it! 
STEP 1: First i have the data.json file, i need to put it on a server first before i can fetch the data from it, (YOU NEED URL TO FETCH DATA) 
STEP 2: i placed that "data.json" file in a github repository, then i deployed it. with this it will get its own (https) in which i can use to fetch data. 
STEP 3: so now that the data from "data.json" is now in a (https) i can finally use FETCH('//example link here') to fetch data. 
STEP 4: i made a javascript file then i fetched the data from the github domain. 
STEP 5: so i finally able to fetch the 'data.json' files and use it for my programs!
